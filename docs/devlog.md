# MkopoGuard v2 — Devlog

## 2026-10-05 — Phase 0 setup

**Did:** Created the repo, virtual environment, folder structure, Ruff + pre-commit, a smoke test and the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

**Broke / learned:** I learnt how to create tests and create a github actions CI pipeline . I made a mistake in the creation of the __init__py files which I was able to resolve by finding the position of the files . I also had an intial conflict in pushing the README file to github after configuring the github actions pipeline but I was able to solve it in good time

**Next:** Phase 1.1 — audit notebook for the 20-country Findex pool.


## 2026-10-06 — Phase 1 Step 1.1 Auditing the dataset


**Did:** I was able to import the dataset to the project and audit it to find the required countries and columns I will be using for this project . I was able to perform tests on the dataset config file to ensure it has been appropriately set.

**Broke / learned:**
Learnt that about the package named as pyarrow which is used for interoperability between packages in python (numpy, pandas and others )
Learnt how to succesfully run notebooks on my machine
Used ISO country codes instead of names because "Côte d'Ivoire" gets mangled

**Decisions:**
- Choices I made and why (or "None")

## 2026-10-06 — Step 1.2: Decode the Findex columns + adults-only decision

**Goal:** Turn the survey's coded column names into plain-English features, and decide which columns the project keeps.

**Did:**
- Created `docs/findex_columns.md`: 23 model features, 1 fairness-audit column (`female`) and 5 identifier/metadata columns, each with a readable name, question text and answer codes
- Checked answer codes against the official World Bank codebook (WLD_2021_FINDEX_v03_M)
- Added a check cell to `notebooks/01_audit.ipynb` confirming all 24 kept columns have data in all 20 countries
- Added `MIN_AGE = 18` and `EXPECTED_APPLICANTS = 18_718` to `config.py`, plus a test (6 tests passing)

**Broke / learned:**
- Many Findex columns are follow-up questions only asked when an earlier answer was "yes", so a high missing share isn't always a data error
- "Don't know", "refused" and "does not apply" codes (e.g. 3/4, or 4/5/6) must become missing values, not real answers
- `fin24a`/`fin24b` looked useful but are missing for up to 48% of respondents in some countries; `fin24` covers the same idea with no gaps

**Decisions:**
- Kept 23 features chosen on four tests: data in all 20 countries, something a loan officer could ask, relevant to repayment risk, and not a follow-up question
- `female` is kept for the fairness audit only, never as a model feature
- **Dropped respondents under 18:** Findex surveys people aged 15+, but minors can't legally take loans. This removes 1,312 respondents aged 15–17 and 30 with no recorded age, so the pool goes from 20,060 respondents to **18,718 applicants** (Kenya: 952; smallest country: Liberia, 874)

## 2026-10-06 — Step 1.3: Findex cleaning module

**Goal:** Turn the raw survey codes into clean, readable data and keep adults only.

**Did:**
- Wrote `src/mkopoguard/data/clean.py`: selects and renames 29 columns, decodes answer codes into values, turns don't know / refused / does not apply into missing, and drops respondents under 18 or with no age
- Added 18 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_clean.py`) using small hand-built rows with known answers
- Added 4 real-data tests (`tests/data/test_findex_real.py`) that skip automatically in CI when the CSV isn't present
- Saved `data/interim/findex_clean.parquet`: 18,718 adult applicants
- Verified the last six column codes against the codebook
- 28 tests passing locally (CI: 24 passed, 4 skipped)

**Broke / learned:**
- `AttributeError: module 'mkopoguard.config' has no attribute 'MIN_AGE'`: the notebook kernel kept an old copy of `config.py` in memory. Fixed by restarting the kernel; added `%load_ext autoreload` / `%autoreload 2` as the first cell to stop it happening again
- `.map(dict)` turns any code not in the dictionary into NaN, which handles don't know / refused automatically
- `Int8` (capital I) is pandas' nullable integer type; plain `int` columns can't hold missing values
- `pytest.mark.parametrize` runs one test function over many inputs
- `pytest.mark.skipif` lets data-dependent tests run locally but skip in CI

**Decisions:**
- Yes/no answers stored as 1/0; categorical answers stored as readable labels (e.g. `cash_only`, `could_not`)
- Kept the 11 respondents aged 99: most likely the survey's top value for "99 or older"
- The cleaning function raises a clear error if an expected column is missing, rather than failing later

## 2026-10-06 — Step 1.4: Simulator design (data card)

**Goal:** Decide on paper how each applicant's loan, mobile money statement and repayment outcome will be generated, before writing any simulator code.

**Did:**
- Wrote `docs/data_card.md`: what's real vs simulated, timeline, hidden traits, loan rules, transaction types, default rule, reproducibility and known limitations
- Checked the mobile money split in the cleaned data: 9,848 applicants (53%) with mobile money, 8,870 (47%) without; Kenya 688 / 264

**Broke / learned:**
- A model can only learn what the simulator puts in. With no noise, or with the default rule built from the same features the model sees, scores look near-perfect but prove nothing
- **Hidden traits** (true income, discipline, stress) drive both transactions and default, but the model only sees their traces in the statement. That's why mobile money data can add information beyond the survey, which the ablation in step 3.7 will test
- A realistic target is ROC-AUC around 0.70–0.85; much higher would mean the simulator is too easy

**Decisions:**
- **Country incomes:** all 20 countries' income quintiles treated as Kenya-equivalent, with no GDP multiplier. Simpler, no extra data source, and the app scores Kenyans. Limitation recorded in the data card
- **No mobile money means no statement:** these 8,870 applicants are thin-file borrowers (`has_statement = 0`), judged on survey answers alone. This matches the original proposal's focus on first-time and informal borrowers. Results will be reported for both groups
- Gender and country are never used in the default rule, to keep the Phase 4 fairness check honest
- Overall default rate target about 20% (band 15–25%); `SIMULATION_SEED = 42`

**Next:** Step 1.5: build the population (load the 18,718 cleaned applicants and draw hidden traits with a fixed seed).
